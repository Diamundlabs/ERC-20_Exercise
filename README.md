# ERC20 Smart Contract Bootcamp Project

Welcome to the ERC20 Smart Contract Bootcamp project! In this project, you will be building an ERC20 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This is a beginner-friendly project that will help you understand the basics of smart contract development and the ERC20 standard.

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a basic ERC20 token that can be used as a tradable asset on the Ethereum blockchain. You will be building a smart contract that conforms to the ERC20 standard, which means that it will be compatible with many existing wallets and exchanges.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this project, we believe you should have a basic understanding of the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract development. You should also be familiar with the Solidity programming language, which is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

### Project Requirements
In order to complete this project, you will need to create a Solidity smart contract that meets the following requirements:

- The smart contract should be written in Solidity version 0.8.0 or later.
- The smart contract should implement the ERC20 token standard.
- The smart contract should have a total supply of 1 billion tokens.
- The token should have the symbol "DMDT" and the name "Diamund Token".
- The decimal places of the token should be 18.
- The contract should have two initial accounts, the deployer, and the recipient.
- The deployer should have 50% of the total supply.
- The recipient should have 50% of the total supply.
- The smart contract should have a function that allows the transfer of tokens between accounts.
- The smart contract should have a function that returns the balance of a specified account.

### Getting Started
To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Inside the repository, you will find a Solidity file named diamundToken.sol. This is the file where you will write your smart contract code.

### Testing
You can test your smart contract using Remix, a web-based Solidity IDE. To use Remix, simply copy and paste your smart contract code into a new file and deploy it to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using the Remix interface.

### Submission
Once you have completed the project, you can submit your code by creating a pull request on this repository. Your pull request should include your Solidity file, a brief description of your implementation, and any additional comments or notes you would like to include.

### Conclusion
Congratulations on completing the ERC20 Smart Contract Bootcamp project! This project should have given you a good understanding of how to write a basic ERC20 smart contract and how to deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers.
